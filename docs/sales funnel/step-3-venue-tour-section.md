### **Visualization Tools:**
During the tour, use these techniques to help couples envision their day:

- **Before/After Photos:** "This is the space set for a ceremony, and here's how it transformed for [Couple's Name]'s wedding last June."
- **Augmented Reality (if available):** Use an iPad to show different table layouts and decor options in each space.
- **Visual Markers:** "Your guests would enter here, cocktail hour would flow to this area, and then dinner would be served in this space."
- **Time-of-Day Context:** "At sunset, this western-facing window creates a golden glow across the entire room, perfect for your first dance."

### **Sensory Experience Enhancement:**

## **Tour-to-Proposal Transition:**
End every tour with these critical steps:

1. **Feedback gathering:** "What spaces could you envision for your ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception?"
2. **Preference confirmation:** "Is there anything specific you'd like me to include in the proposal I'll be preparing for you?"
3. **Timeline setting:** "I'll have a custom proposal to you by [specific day/time]. When would be a good time to review it together?"
4. **Next steps clarity:** "After you receive the proposal, I'll follow up with a call to answer any questions and discuss available dates."
5. **Date discussion:** "While I'm preparing your proposal, would you like me to temporarily hold any specific dates for you? We're currently booking [timeframe] weddings."

## **Post-Tour Analysis:**
After each tour, document in your CRM:
- Spaces that received the most positive reactions
