# **1. Initial Inquiry Response (Top of Funnel)**

**Goal:** Respond quickly and personally to inquiries to secure interest and establish trust.

**Platform:** Inquiries via Perfect Venue, The Knot, Wedding Wire, and website contact form.

## **Best Practices:**
- **Respond within 1 hour** during business hours; within 12 hours after-hours.
- Use **personalized emails** addressing the couple by name.
- Mirror the tone of the inquiry (formal/informal, excited/casual).
- **Source-specific templates:** Customize response templates based on where the inquiry originated (Knot vs. Website vs. Social Media), as each platform attracts different types of couples with varying expectations.

## **Immediate Follow-Up Call Strategy:**
- After receiving the inquiry, **place a phone call as soon as possible**.
- If the couple answers, warmly introduce yourself, congratulate them, and offer to answer any immediate questions.
- If there's no answer, **leave a brief, friendly voicemail**:
  > "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Milea Estate Vineyard. I just received your wedding inquiry and wanted to personally congratulate you and connect about your big day. I'd love to chat and answer any questions you have. I'll also send you a quick text and email. Looking forward to speaking with you!"

- Immediately after, send a **short follow-up text message**:
  > "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Milea Estate Vineyard. I just left you a voicemail and would love to chat about your wedding inquiry. Feel free to call or text back when it's convenient!"

- Then, send a follow-up **email** providing all the information they asked for and confirming your outreach:

## **Email Template:**
```
Subject: Congratulations [First Name] – Let's Plan Your Perfect Wedding at Milea!

Hi [First Name],

## **Enhanced Connection Strategies:**

### **Ask About Their Story**
In your second communication (whether email, call, or text), ask the couple about their engagement story. This personal touch creates emotional connection:

> "I'd love to hear a bit about your engagement story if you're willing to share! How did you two meet and what makes your relationship special?"

### **Video Message Follow-Up**
After the initial email exchange, send a brief (30-60 second) personalized video message welcoming the couple and expressing excitement about potentially hosting their wedding:

```
Subject: A quick hello from Milea Estate Vineyard!

Hi [Names],

I wanted to take a moment to personally welcome you to the Milea family. I've attached a quick video message introducing myself and our beautiful venue.

Looking forward to potentially hosting your special day!
