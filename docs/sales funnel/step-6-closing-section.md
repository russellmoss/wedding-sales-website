# **6. Closing (Conversion)**

**Goal:** Secure a signed contract and deposit, converting interest into a confirmed booking.

## **Steps:**
- Clearly outline how to move forward: digital contract + deposit
- Use a simple subject line: "Ready to Make It Official?"
- Provide support: offer to walk through the contract on a call
- Create a sense of celebration around the decision
- Make the signing process as simple and streamlined as possible

## **Closing Call Strategy:**

When a couple expresses interest in moving forward, schedule a dedicated closing call with these components:

### **Opening (2-3 minutes):**
- Express excitement about their decision
- Reinforce why Milea is the perfect choice for their vision
- Set clear agenda for the call: "Today we'll review the contract details, answer any questions, and discuss next steps"

### **Contract Review (5-7 minutes):**
- Walk through key contract points (not every line)
- Highlight important dates, payment schedule, and policies
- Address common questions before they're asked
- Emphasize flexibility and customization options

### **Objection Handling (as needed):**
- Listen fully to any concerns without interrupting
- Validate their concerns: "That's a great question..."
- Provide clear, honest responses
- Offer solutions or alternatives when possible

### **Closing the Deal (3-5 minutes):**
- Summarize next steps clearly
- Explain exactly how to submit contract and deposit
- Set timeline expectations: "Once we receive your signed contract and deposit, we'll..."
- End with genuine excitement about working together
