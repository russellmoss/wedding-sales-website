Based on your current wedding sales funnel document, I suggest integrating these enhancements strategically within each existing section. Here's how I would incorporate them:

### 1. Initial Inquiry Response (Top of Funnel)
- Add the "Ask about their story" and "Video messages" suggestions right after your existing email template
- Insert "Source-specific templates" in the "Best Practices" subsection
- These additions complement your already strong 1-hour response protocol

### 2. Qualification (Top-Mid Funnel)
- Expand your "Sample Questions" subsection to include the budget conversation framework, decision timeline, and vision/priority mapping questions
- This builds upon your existing qualification approach without disrupting it

### 3. Venue Tour (Mid Funnel)
- Add a new subsection called "Tour Enhancement Strategies" after "Onsite Tour Tips"
- Include the pre-tour excitement building, visualization tools, tasting experience, and digital takeaway concepts
- These elements strengthen your already solid tour framework

### 4. Proposal (Bottom Funnel)
- Create a new subsection titled "Proposal Structure" before your "Email Language" part
- Include the tiered options, visual proposals, social proof, and "Why Milea" section
- These complement your 24-hour turnaround protocol

### 5. Follow-Up (Bottom Funnel)
- Integrate the decision facilitator role, seasonal urgency, and milestone acknowledgment concepts directly into your existing follow-up schedule
- Each of these can be mapped to your Day 2, Day 5, and Day 10 touchpoints to make them more strategic

### 6. New Section: "Technology Enablement"
- Create this entirely new section between your existing "Follow-Up" and "Closing" sections
- Include the text message integration, lead scoring system, and abandoned inquiry recovery strategies
- This positions technology as the enabler between follow-up and closing

### 7. Closing (Conversion)
- Add the competitive positioning elements (competitive analysis document, "Why couples choose us") to strengthen your closing strategy
- These provide sales staff with tools to address last-minute hesitations

### 8. Post-Booking Engagement (Retention & Upsell)
- Directly incorporate the planning portal, vendor introduction program, and anniversary marketing into your existing post-booking section
- These naturally extend your current retention strategies

This integration approach preserves the strong structure of your existing funnel while seamlessly incorporating the new elements to create a more comprehensive, conversion-focused sales process.
