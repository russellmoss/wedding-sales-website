**Milea Estate Vineyard: Wedding Sales Funnel & Response Strategy**

**Objective:**
Maximize conversion of wedding inquiries into booked events by utilizing a research-backed, step-by-step sales funnel strategy.

---

### **1. Initial Inquiry Response (Top of Funnel)**
**Goal:** Respond quickly and personally to inquiries to secure interest and establish trust.

**Platform:** Inquiries via Perfect Venue, The Knot, Wedding Wire, and website contact form.

**Best Practices:**
- **Respond within 1 hour** during business hours; within 12 hours after-hours.
- Use **personalized emails** addressing the couple by name.
- Mirror the tone of the inquiry (formal/informal, excited/casual).

**Immediate Follow-Up Call Strategy:**
- After receiving the inquiry, **place a phone call as soon as possible**.
- If the couple answers, warmly introduce yourself, congratulate them, and offer to answer any immediate questions.
- If there's no answer, **leave a brief, friendly voicemail**:
  > "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Milea Estate Vineyard. I just received your wedding inquiry and wanted to personally congratulate you and connect about your big day. I’d love to chat and answer any questions you have. I’ll also send you a quick text and email. Looking forward to speaking with you!"

- Immediately after, send a **short follow-up text message**:
  > "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Milea Estate Vineyard. I just left you a voicemail and would love to chat about your wedding inquiry. Feel free to call or text back when it’s convenient!"

- Then, send a follow-up **email** providing all the information they asked for and confirming your outreach:

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Congratulations [First Name] – Let's Plan Your Perfect Wedding at Milea!

Hi [First Name],

Thank you so much for your interest in hosting your wedding at Milea Estate Vineyard. Congratulations on your engagement – such an exciting time!

I just tried giving you a quick call and left a voicemail to introduce myself – I also sent you a text in case that’s easier for you.

Our Clubhouse can accommodate up to 120 guests and features panoramic views of the Hudson Valley, a world-class catering kitchen, and a dedicated event coordinator to help bring your dream wedding to life.

We’d love to schedule a tour and hear more about your vision. When are you available this week or next?

Warmest wishes,
[Your Name]  
Event Coordinator, Milea Estate Vineyard

### **2. Qualification (Top-Mid Funnel)**
**Goal:** Determine if the couple is a good fit for the venue and gather essential info.

**Strategies:**
- Ask a few soft questions in the follow-up to guide the conversation.
- Avoid overwhelming them with too many details.

**Sample Questions:**
- "How many guests are you planning for?"
- "What season or date are you envisioning?"
- "Do you have a planner or are you working together directly?"

---

### **3. Venue Tour (Mid Funnel)**
**Goal:** Get the couple onsite to experience the property and envision their event.

**Best Practices:**
- Offer both in-person and virtual tour options.
- Send a confirmation email with address, directions, and contact info.
- Prepare by reviewing their inquiry and preferences beforehand.

**Onsite Tour Tips:**
- Greet them by name with a glass of wine.
- Focus on personalization: “Imagine this as your ceremony backdrop...”
- Share past wedding stories/testimonials.
- Introduce value-added services (e.g., wine pairings, dinners, rehearsal dinner options).

---

### **4. Proposal (Bottom Funnel)**
**Goal:** Deliver a customized proposal promptly after the tour.

**Best Practices:**
- Send proposal within 24 hours of the tour.
- Include itemized pricing, options, and clear next steps.
- Emphasize scarcity and value: e.g., “We have just one Saturday left in October 2025.”

**Email Language:**
"Attached is your customized proposal based on everything we discussed. I’ve also held your preferred date for 5 business days. Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to move forward with securing the date."

---

### **5. Follow-Up (Bottom Funnel)**
**Goal:** Stay top-of-mind and move toward a booking decision.

**Schedule:**
- **Day 2:** Friendly check-in: "Just wanted to make sure you received everything."
- **Day 5:** Scarcity-based message: "We’re getting more October inquiries and wanted to check in before the date is released."
- **Day 10:** Offer added value: "Happy to include a complimentary wine tasting for you and your partner if you’d like to return."

---

### **6. Closing (Conversion)**
**Goal:** Secure a signed contract and deposit.

**Steps:**
- Clearly outline how to move forward: digital contract + deposit.
- Use a simple subject line: "Ready to Make It Official?"
- Provide support: offer to walk through the contract on a call.

**Final Touch:**
Send a branded thank-you gift or handwritten card upon booking. This cements emotional investment.

---

### **7. Post-Booking Engagement (Retention & Upsell)**
**Goal:** Turn a booked couple into an enthusiastic ambassador.

**Best Practices:**
- Introduce them to their dedicated planner or coordinator.
- Send a planning timeline or welcome kit.
- Invite them to exclusive Milea events: tastings, seasonal dinners, etc.
- Encourage reviews and referrals.

---

### **Bonus: CRM Tips (Perfect Venue Specific)**
- Use tags to categorize hot leads, tour completed, proposal sent, and booked.
- Automate task reminders for follow-ups.
- Track response time metrics and tour conversion rate.

---

**Summary:**
By guiding wedding inquiries through a thoughtful, emotionally resonant, and structured sales funnel—from fast response to personalized touchpoints and strategic follow-ups—Milea Estate Vineyard can significantly increase bookings while creating a standout customer experience.
