## Events & Planning

### Can we have an afterparty?
We offer after parties for an additional cost until 1am. Music must be kept at a reduced volume to be mindful of our neighbors.

*The town of Clinton has a noise ordinance of 8pm for any outdoor music. But fear not, you are welcome to keep the party going until 11pm inside.*

### What happens in case of inclement weather?
We have you covered with an outdoor pergola that has roofing, screens, heaters, and fans. No matter the weather, the clubhouse can host your entire event inside. Your events team will have a rain plan ready for you if the ceremony or cocktail hour are outside.

Important to note, we do not have tenting or portable heaters. We are happy to provide you with companies who can accommodate these requests for you.

### Am I required to have my own event planner?
Yes. The planner could be with you the entire time you are planning your event or just for the day on site. The planner or coordinator is required to be from a legitimate business and must be chosen at least 2 months prior to the day of the wedding.

## Food & Beverage

### Are there upgrades available to the menu options?
Additional enhancements and packages are available for you to choose from. These include but are not limited to: additional entrées, sides, salads, canapés, cheese and charcuterie, desserts, and bar packages. Please contact our events coordinator for more details.

### If I want something that is off menu or to modify your menu, am I allowed to do so?
Yes! Our talented culinary team is able to accommodate modifications and requests. If you want a menu inspired by cultural heritage or just your favorite foods, please speak with our events coordinator to see what we can do for you.

### Do you offer any menu or wine tastings before my event?
Absolutely we do! We encourage you to come in and try our food and wine to help you select your favorites. Dinner menu and wine tastings are for an additional fee and are optional but encouraged.

## Logistics

### Where do my guests park?
Onsite parking - in the parking lot we can host up to 60 cars. Guests are also welcome to park along our driveway which can host another 60 cars or at our farm across the street from the vineyard.

### Are my guests allowed to smoke on property?
We are proud to be a smoke-free property. Smoking is not allowed indoors as per federal regulations. Smoking locations can be established on the property for your event. Excessive cigarette butts on the ground may incur an additional cleaning fee.

### Is Milea pet friendly?
We do love our four-legged friends but we kindly ask that they remain leashed both inside and outside. Grapes are unsafe for dogs to consume and we want to make sure they are protected. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
